          I am 6 feet tall and 220 lbs. This shirt fit me perfectly in the chest
          and shoulders. My only complaint is that it is so long! I like to wear
          polo shirts untucked. This shirt goes completely past my rear end. If
          I wore it with ordinary shorts, you probably wouldnt be able to see
          the shorts at all â€“ completely hidden by the shirt. It needs to be 4
          to 5 inches shorter in terms of length to suit me. I have many RL polo
          shirts, and this one is by far the longest. I dont understand why.
